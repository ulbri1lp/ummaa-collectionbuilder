A. spear, bamboo, metal, rattan, fiber 

spear made with long bamboo shaft. The upper section of the shaft is enclosed by a metal tube with 3 raised sections of bonds. This probably serves as a ferrule? A few other sections of the shaft near this are wrapped with rattan bands and a fiber cord. A metal wire wraps around the shaft in a few places and runs the length of the shaft near the top, winding around itself in sections. Attached to that end is a metal head with a thick base and an elongated triangular shaped blade that tapers to a point. The metal head has been coated in something thatmakes it glossy.  


B. sheath, wood, rattan. Measures: 41 by 7 by 4 

sheath fits over blade. Made of 2 pieces of dark colored light weight wood cut so they form identical halves that form a sheath when fitted together. At the end, the wood flares out forming a bulbous tip. The sheath is held together by 2 bands of woven rattan.; ",,,8162,
